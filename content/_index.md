      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research interests include interactive robotics, compliant control algorithms, and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). I am currently researching energy-based control methods for safe pHRI, that can guarantee energy limitation for robotic manipulators both within and outside of contact scenarios. I leverage modern controls and dynamical systems theory for controller analysis and design.
        
        I am privileged to have had the opportunity to work with several interesting robots. I designed customized controllers for the Reachy Robot by Pollen Robotics at the Human-Robot Collaboration lab at the University of Calgary. I also recently had the chance to do part of my research at the University of Waterloo's RoboHub, where I had the opportunity of implementing a novel compliant controller on the Talos Humanoid Robot by Pal Robotics.
