## Thesis Defense

On January 15th 2025, I successfully defended my Master's Thesis in the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Calgary. My thesis is titled "Adaptive PD Gains for Energy-Conscious Control in Physical Human-Robot Interaction", and proposes a novel control algorithm for safe physical human-robot interaction. The thesis may be found [**here**](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/items/cdf66541-e6c6-468b-a76a-7e4d9721a715).
