## About Me

I am a MSc student at the University of Calgary's Mechanical Engineering department, with research focusing on Robotics and Controls. I am a part of the Human-Robot Collaboration lab, supervised by Dr. Marie Charbonneau. My research focuses on control algorithms that can make physical Human-Robot interaction safe, by behaving compliantly (or softly) in response to human contact.
