abstract: Safety in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is an important area of research. Impedance control methods require force feedback, appropriate sensing, and are coordinate dependent. The alternatives are energy-limiting approaches, but such schemes may be complex to implement. We propose an adaptive PD controller by extending these energy limitation concepts to PD controllers! We can ensure safety by complying with the ISO/TS 15066 standards.
